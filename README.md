# Homework: Code Refactor
In this assignment I first started by linking the css file to the html file. Then proceed to "clean" up the html file 
so it would be easier to understand, also arranged and condensed the css file. After, I opened the html on my
browser and proceeded to see what need to be fixed including images and unclickable links.
